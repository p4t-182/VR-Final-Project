# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

*Wham! - A VR Whac-a-Mole experience*

*Patrick Hunt, Joseph Pleasant*

## Project Description

Wham! is a virtual reality whac-a-mole experience. This game takes the traditional whac-a-mole experience and places it in VR, which gives the game a new layer of life. The game will feature additional functionality compared to what is seen in traditional whac-a-mole implementations including locomotion around the scene via teleportation, hostile moles which shoot at the player, and a handheld mallet which has the ability to deflect enemy shots Look to pay attention to your surroundings to notice animation querks that helps reinvigorate the experience. Additionally, this project will place emphasis on the use of assets to create a cartoon-like gaming experience which will enhance overall gameplay.

## Feature Breakdown

| **Implementation**   | **Description** | **Difficulty** |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| **Teleportation** | The player will be able to move around the scene to hit enemies by teleporting to different teleportation pads.      | We are expecting the difficulty to be a 1/5, because we are both already familiar with implementing such functionality.                |
| **Gopher Shoot**| The moles will shoot at the player throughout the game.  |   We are also expecting a difficulty of 1/5 because we have implemented this already in a separate project.             |
| **Bullet Deflection**   | The player will be able to deflect the moles' bullets with the mallet in an arbitrary direction to avoid being hit.       |          The difficulty for this implementation will be a 3/5. Determining how specifically the bullet will be deflected (direction, etc.) will be challenging.      |
| **Visual Effects/Cues**   | Upon actions of the previously stated features, there will be coinciding visuals and sounds that affect the scene.       |          The difficulty for this implementation will be a 4/5. This implementation will be time consuming and will require some research in order to achieve our desired effects.     |

## Milestones
1. **By 11/19** - Basic game functionality will be done. Minimal assets will be used for objects such as the mallet. Overall low level game design will be done.
2. **By 12/5** - The game will be polished using assets and sounds, we plan on having done some research and basic implementation for the visual cues in the game. Most of the previous features will be polished by this date.

## Inspirations
**Tetris Effect** 

This is an inspiration of ours because it demonstrates how a simple game can be augmented through the use of visual cues.

**Human Whac-a-Mole**

We like the idea of one large circle containing all of the moles similar to what is seen in this video.

**Donkey Kong Country style mashing**

For our level finishing moment we were thinking of a rapid mash moment similar to the ones in Donkey Kong
