# Final Project Proposal: XR Arcade

*Wham! - A VR Whack-a-Mole experience*

*Patrick Hunt, Joseph Pleasant*

## Project Description

Wham! is a virtual reality whack-a-mole experience. This game takes the traditional whack-a-mole experience and places it in VR, which gives the game a new layer of life. The game will feature additional functionality compared to what is seen in traditional whack-a-mole implementations including locomotion around the scene via teleportation, hostile moles which shoot at the player, and a handheld mallet which has the ability to deflect enemy shots Look to pay attention to your surroundings to notice animation querks that helps reinvigorate the experience. Additionally, this project will place emphasis on the use of assets to create a cartoon-like gaming experience which will enhance overall gameplay.

2. ETC…
